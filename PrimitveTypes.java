    /*
     *  Every value is either, one of 8 primitives, or a reference to an object
     *  Java is strongly typed-every variable is of a specific type.
     *  
     *  Primitive Data Types
     *  boolean
     *  char
     *  byte
     *  short
     *  long
     *  int
     *  float
     *  double
     *  
     *  
     *  Overflow:
     *  results of opeartion are truncated to fit in the size of the type
     *  int can store -2147483648 to 2147483648
     *  if overflow is a possibility use long
     *  Rounding errors
     *  -floating point numbers have limited precision
     *  round off errors may occur
     *  a double has more precision than a float
     *  care is needed when comparing floating-point values (i.e., use of epsilon values)
